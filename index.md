\# _datagenous_

\#### data devOps 

\### built to address the hidden operational challenges of data driven development

As organizations respond to a business environment of rapid change, uncertainty, risk and complexity, they increasingly need to take full advantage of their data assets. This means faster and more adaptive integration across systems, and operationalization of data driven development such as AI and ML.

Market research estimates that the _¨glue code*_ developed by organizations to address the challenges of data centric development such as ML constitutes **at least 95%** of a mature systems implementation. This is not sustainable.

\### *what we enable*

Our technology provides a continuous \[data devOps\]() integration environment to concurrently manage, integrate and semantically reconcile data resources with varying sample rates, from millisecond sensor streams to large archival data sets, on existing infrastructure while shifting opportunistically among centralized, federated, and distributed service deployment patterns.

The **_datagenous_** service enables you to focus on business questions first, by inverting the traditional approach to data service development through a process we call retrospective late binding **(RLB)**. **RLB** enables teams to embrace a **minimally viable implementation (MVI)** approach, in which business requirements don't have to wait for the promise of a new capability or rely expensive, fragile, opaque, and difficult to maintain ¨glue code¨.

\### *low risk high return*

\**_datagenous_** helps organizations iteratively evolve data services, adhere to open standards, preserve modularity, and guide the infrastructural investment in big data as concrete incremental optimizations. Our **data devOps** technology has supported these processes to produce **10X comparative gains in ROI** when compared to traditional data service design and integration.

\### *what we are used for*

\**_datagenous_** is currently used in enterprise deployments to:

 

\- develop and operate industrial digital twin architectures for product ontogeny, genealogy, quality, and traceability

\- support the complex data transfers and provenance services to execute mergers acquisitions and spinoffs while minimizing the impact on business operations

\- integrate and manage heterogeneous evolving product lifecycle management (PLM) systems with business intelligence (BI) systems and architectures

\- develop and deploy edge analytics for intelligent industrial IoT manufacturing

\**_datagenous_** also powers a free public dydra service for non profit and academic work that supports over 1100 users and 2000 data services handling over 2,8 million requests in the last year.

\### *where we are going*

We are extending our service into ML.  We are extending our interfaces into a JavaScript, collaborative data notebook programming environments.  Our aim is to permit devOps teams to iterate and develop new ML complimented data services. We are looking for early adopters of this capability who have proof of concept applications they wish to realize.

 

We are developing the next iteration of a UX for our environment based in literate programming and direct manipulation principles and technologies (phosphorjs and jupterylabs) allowing domain experts to program and perform data experiments without coding, while preserving the ability for developers to access data workflows at whatever level of technical depth they require.
